    """Basic implementation of a Cluster.

    The cluster is in charge of creating the cluster of instances where
    one host is the Orchestrator while the other ones are Factories.

    This implementation should not be used by an end user.
    In order to give support to a cloud service provider (ex: AWS),
    a child class must be implemented inheriting from the Cluster class.

    *Important: when possible, Clusters should context managers*

    Parameters
    ----------
    name: str
        The name of the cluster, used to name the remote instances.
    factories_num : int
        The amount of factories to use. Note that this differs from
        the number of workers,  as each factories can contain multiple
        GPUs and therefore, multiple workers.
    key: str
        The path to the ssh key used to communicate to all instances.
        IMPORTANT: all instances must be accessible with the same key.
    username: str
        The username of the instances the cluster will handle.
        IMPORTANT: for now all instances need to have the same username.
    setup_cmds: Optional[List[str]]
        A list of commands to be run on all hosts for setup purposes.
        These commands can be used to mount volumes, install software,
        etc. Defaults to None.
        IMPORTANT: the commands need to be idempotent and they shouldn't
        expect user input.
